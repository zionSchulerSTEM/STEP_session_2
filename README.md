Algebra, Geometry, Calculus

## Preliminaries
The goal of this session is to give you all a big picture view of what algebra and geometry, how it enables us to use concepts from calculus in interesting ways, and why it is a useful tool to keep sharp in your mathematical toolkit. Before diving into the focus of this session, we will take a look at some of the fundamental concepts that these topics build on. Many of these concepts will be familiar to you all, but I will present them here for the sake of completeness.

### Functions
In its most general sense, a function is a mapping of one collection of objects to another collection of objects. Typically, the collection of objects in interest are numbers, and the way we map one set of numbers to another set of numbers usually follows some rule that might be specified in either words or symbols. It is typically ideal to specify a function in symbols since it is more difficult to confuse what one means in mathematical symbols than it is to confuse the meaning of words. However, most real world / interesting problems require astute mathematicians to translate a problem from words into symbols that can be manipulated in ways that allow us to make interesting observations about the problem. An example of a function that we might specify using words would be "the kinetic energy of a moving object is proportional to the square of the velocity of the object". In symbols, this would be 
$$E \propto v^2$$
The little squiggly symbol in the middle of the letters means "is proportional to". Not only is the symbolic, mathematical way of writing the function smaller (it takes less characters to write the same idea), but it is also in a form that is ready for manipulation. It is very easy to make mistakes when translating from words to mathematical symbols, so I would advise you all to be patient and careful when translating words to symbols to ensure that a trivial (yet understandable) mistake occurs early in the process and invalidates all of the quality work you do afterwords (and often leaves you with a flat out incorrect answer). 

#### Analytic Functions
There are truly lots of different types of functions out there. At this point in your mathematical careers, however, the primary focus of your attention is centered around a small group of "analytic functions". Analytic function has a precise definition, but for now you can think of them as the functions that you can draw on a graph without lifting up your pencil. These functions are the polynomials, the trig functions (like cosine, sine, cosecant, etc), exponential functions, and logarithmic functions.
